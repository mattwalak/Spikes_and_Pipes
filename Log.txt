HARD CORE CODING:
10/3	9:00pm		2:40				Redesigned control flow. Made new files for each location of control (title_screen.lua, level_select.lua, game.lua). Also reorganized supporting file structure
10/8	5:30pm		1:00				Began redesigning obstacle representation structure to make crazy recursive things possible.
10/14	9:00pm		1:00				Began working on game structure. Set up level reading system (Each level stored as .lua file)
10/14	10:40pm		1:10				Began implementing methods to display and animate obstacles
10/14	12:00pm		0:45				Continued implementing methods to display and animate obstacles (Recursive animation). Obstacles now appear on screen and things!
10/17	11:10pm		0:50				Continued implementing methods to display and animate obstacles (Yes, still recursive animation)	
10/19	8:30am		1:35				Finally figured out my numbering system for keyframes. Continued writing keyframeObstacle()	
10/19	10:20am		1:00				Keyframing system and obstacle presentation works! Working on destroying objects on animation finish
10/20	8:10pm		0:40				Continued work on destroying objects on animation finish... Decided obstacle data needs to be stored differently for easier acsess (To hard to stop obstacles when they need to be removed from the screen)
