HARD CORE CODING:
10/3	9:00pm		2:40				Redesigned control flow. Made new files for each location of control (title_screen.lua, level_select.lua, game.lua). 
											Also reorganized supporting file structure
10/8	5:30pm		1:00				Began redesigning obstacle representation structure to make crazy recursive things possible.
10/14	9:00pm		1:00				Began working on game structure. Set up level reading system (Each level stored as .lua file)
10/14	10:40pm		1:10				Began implementing methods to display and animate obstacles
10/14	12:00pm		0:45				Continued implementing methods to display and animate obstacles (Recursive animation). Obstacles now appear on screen and things!
10/17	11:10pm		0:50				Continued implementing methods to display and animate obstacles (Yes, still recursive animation)	
10/19	8:30am		1:35				Finally figured out my numbering system for keyframes. Continued writing keyframeObstacle()	
10/19	10:20am		1:00				Key-framing system and obstacle presentation works! Working on destroying objects on animation finish
10/20	8:10pm		0:40				Continued work on destroying objects on animation finish... Decided obstacle data needs to be stored differently for 
											easier acsess (Too hard to stop obstacles when they need to be removed from the screen)
10/20	9:10pm		0:50				Discovered transition.cancel(), using it to stop animations mid transition.
10/20	10:20pm		1:00				Began writing composer scene transition/setup code for game.lua
10/23	9:50pm		1:00				Implemented memory leak checking print statements. Changed obstacle.object to obstacle.objects (Can now have a table)
											NOTE: For some reason memory is not freed from obstacles between scenes. Should check into that
											NOTE: Using the transition.to() command on large tables of objects creates unacceptable differences between object
													paths when lots of objects/obstacles are loaded. Must find a more precise method
10/24	4:00pm		1:20				Began implementing bubbles! (Also physics)
10/24	5:30pm		1:00				Realized that physics doesn't work with moving display groups... Researched alternatives. Looks like we are heading 
											into the great big obstacle motion rewrite!
10/24	7:55pm		1:20				Designed new "Null object" structure (Think After Effects) for representing obstacles and for handling display object inheritance
10/24	9:30pm		1:25				Began implementing "Null object" structure. Rewrote createObstacle() method. Rewrote keyframeObstacle() (now keyframeNull)
10/25	8:25pm		1:25				Continued implementing "Null object" structure. Debugged createObstacle() and keyframeNull() methods. Began writing 
											DisplayObject manipulation methods
10/26	10:10am		0:50				Continued implementing "Null object" structure. DisplayObject manipulation methods work for position.
10/26	9:30pm		0:30				Debugging object manipulation methods
10/31	6:00pm		1:20				Changed to 9:16 letterbox display. Added bubble intro animation. Bubbles work with physics now!
10/31	7:50pm		0:40				I tried to implement gravity and tragically failed.
10/31	9:30pm		1:15				Implemented gravity. Implemented touch forces.
11/1	9:20pm		1:00				Implemented grouping for bubble groups (For calculating forces).
11/14	3:00pm		2:30				Finished implementing grouping for bubble groups. Played around with forces to figure out what give both control and a 
											sense of randomness	
11/14	7:55pm		2:00				Implemented collisions, spikes, and bubble popping	
11/14	10:40pm		0:20				Made first build		
11/15	1:40pm		1:30				Began re-writing obstacle inheritance things for easier level building
11/21	2:20pm		1:50				Debugged new inheritance method. Began writing level building utilities
11/22	10:00am		0:40				Continued work on implementing spikeLine
11/22	5:45pm		1:15				Debugged spikeLine, wrote wrapLoopPath
11/24	1:35pm		1:50				Added null rotation, fixed weird dissapearing spikes, implemented sprites (for coin and other powerups)
11/24	7:35pm		0:40				Added masking bars
11/24	8:50pm		0:50				Implemented 4square(). Started making things easier for nestled obstacles
11/24	10:15pm		1:15				Adjusted speed for obstacles that travel more than display.contentHeight. Made first finished obstacles
11/25	10:40am		1:00				Accounted for varying spike size. Wrote second intro level
11/25	12:30pm		1:00				Made coin circle. Debugged coin collection functionality
11/25	2:40pm		1:10				Still trying to get this coin thing to work
11/25	8:00pm		1:00				Added .colected tag for coins. Wrote still4Square()
11/25	9:00pm		0:50				Wrote clear(), stopTransitions(), and implemented gameover().
											NOTE: Coins issue "not found in table" from util.removeFromList() -> see TODO.txt
11/15	12:35pm		1:30				Implemented "pull force" bubble movement. Experimented with distance also playing a role
12/12	2:30pm		1:00				Implemented "Swipe to blow wind" bubble movement (Based on velocity of touch and distance from touch)
12/12	8:30pm		0:30				Implement wind type selection on level select screen
12/13	9:15pm		1:45				Implemented text object. Added fillHorizontalLine_, stillText_, and stillLine_. Began building intro sequence
12/14	11:35am		0:20				Tried to fix coin collecting error. Upon realizing this is actually a larger memory management error I gave up.
12/14	2:05pm		1:30				Began writing new level building tools to build more complex levels
12/14	8:05pm		1:00				Continued work on new level building tools
12/15	12:30am		1:00				Finished helper methods and basic objects/patterns for level building tools
12/15	12:20pm		1:40				Re-created line and foursquare with new level building tools
12/15	3:10pm		1:35				Created pingpong line. Realized I have a big big rotation issue
12/15	10:05pm		1:40				Wrote squareLine_, fillAllColumns_, rewrote intro level 
12/16	10:15pm		1:00				Continued working on intro level. Began writing newPingpongFillColumns_()
--- Boat times are aproximate ---
12/21				0:30				Wrote pingpongFillColumns_()
12/22	12:00pm		0:50				Implemented fan_(). Began work on doubleThwomp_()
12/23	5:05pm		0:30				Wrote some randomly ready obstacles
12/24	10:30am 	0:50				Implemented zigzag_()
12/24	11:50am		0:40				Implemented other diagonal latics obstacles and multiple1Square_ and singleSquare_
