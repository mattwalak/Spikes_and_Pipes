NEXT STEPS:
1. Add forces around edge to prevent bubbles from leaving screen + make it easy to recover
2. Add spikes + collision detection
3. Continue experimenting with touch forces
4. Test build

THING TO DO BEFORE RELEASE:
1. Figure out the deal with setting displayObjects and nullObjects to nil, without making it impossible to load the same level twice
2. Improve bubble grouping algorithm
