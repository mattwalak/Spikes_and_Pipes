NEXT STEPS:
1. Make tutorial (Will probably need to add text as scrolling object)
2. Start building beginner levels (Do this first! This might impact menu design)
3. Menu design


PLZ CHECK:
1. Check keyframe time interpolation numbers (Does looping back to first keyframe use last time value or first?)
2. Coins issue "Not found in table" when calling util.removeFromList() when level 2 is launched a second time after game overing
3. ^^^ Check everything (memory usage, .collected status) when a level is quit or restarted
4. YOU'VE GOT A ROTATION PROBLEM!!! THINGS DONT ROTATE NORMALLY



THING TO DO BEFORE RELEASE:
1. Figure out the deal with setting displayObjects and nullObjects to nil, without making it impossible to load the same level twice
2. Improve bubble grouping algorithm


IDEAS!!!
1. Increase scrolling speed as number of bubbles goes down (Would require re-writing transition to to be clock based)
