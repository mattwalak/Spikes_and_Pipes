NEXT STEPS:
1. Create some test levels (Modify level structure code as needed)
2. Add powerups


PLZ CHECK:
1. Check keyframe time interpolation numbers (Does looping back to first keyframe use last time value or first?)



THING TO DO BEFORE RELEASE:
1. Figure out the deal with setting displayObjects and nullObjects to nil, without making it impossible to load the same level twice
2. Improve bubble grouping algorithm
